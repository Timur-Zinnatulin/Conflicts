boasted diverse wordsizes, precisions, rounding procedures and over/underflow behaviors, and more were in the
works. “Portable” software intended to reconcile that numerical diversity had become unbearably costly to
develop.
despite the challenge it posed to implementors. With unprecedented altruism, hardware designers had risen to its
succeed to a considerable extent. Anyway, rounding anomalies that preoccupied all of us in the 1970s afflict only 
so those features are mishandled and/or practically unusable,
