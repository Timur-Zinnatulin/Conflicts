boasted diverse wordsizes, precisions, rounding procedures and over/underflow behaviors, and more were in the
works. “Portable” software intended to reconcile that numerical diversity had become unbearably costly to
develop.
despite the challenge it posed to implementors. With unprecedented altruism, hardware designers had risen to its

To help break that circle,  those features are discussed in these notes under the following headings:
